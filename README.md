## Running the game
 * Check the wiki for [OGS](https://github.com/Desbaratat/nxengine-evo/wiki/Runing-Cave-Story-on-OGS)
 * Check the [Releases](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/releases) page and download the latest version if you'd rather not build it yourself.

## Differences from the original version of NXEngine:
* Port to SDL2 (thanks to [PIlin](https://github.com/PIlin/NXEngine-iOS))
* More resolutions and proper widescreen support up to Full HD (thanks to [EXL](https://github.com/EXL/NXEngine))
* Animated character portraits
* Modern main menu
* Credits graphics specific to the Mimiga Mask ending
* Localization support
* Force feedback support
* Custom soundtrack support
* Initial mod support
* Vita/Switch versions
* Cleaner and partly-refactored code
* Tons of gameplay-related bugfixes
* Removed built-in data extractor
* Removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway
